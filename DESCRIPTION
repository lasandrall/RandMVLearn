Description: We present scalable randomized kernel methods for jointly associating data from multiple sources and 
             simultaneously predicting an outcome or classifying a unit into one of two or more classes. 
             The proposed methods model nonlinear relationships in multiview data together with predicting 
             a clinical outcome and are capable of identifying variables or groups of variables that best 
             contribute to the relationships among the views. We use the idea that random Fourier bases 
             can approximate shift-invariant kernel functions to construct nonlinear mappings of each view 
             and we use these mappings and the outcome variable to learn view-independent 
             low-dimensional representations.
